## Algorithmic Process

- Load the "Plotly" library
- Define and Assign the names of the Axes
- Develop the 3D Scatter Plot of the "mtcars" dataset with:
    + MPG assigned to the x-Axis
    + WT assigned to the y-Axis
    + HP assigned to the z-Axis
    + Colors of bullets according to the car type

## 3D Scatterplot Result

(*)In case the plot is not appearing simply move the cursor on the slide or click in the blank space. The user can move the 3D plot as he7 she likes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))

axx <- list(title = "MPG") 
axy <- list(title = "WT")
axz <- list(title = "HP")

plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = mtcars$wt, y = mtcars$mpg, z = mtcars$hp, 
        color = as.factor(mtcars$cyl),
        type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis=axx,yaxis=axy,zaxis=axz),title="Cars Plot")
```
